# MachineLearning2024

This project was created during Machine Learning course in autumn 2024. The purpose of the project was to re-write a simple audio refognizing model.
By following TensorFlow's tutorial on Simple audio recognition: Recognizing keywords (https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/audio/simple_audio.ipynb), I first built a Keras model to use as the starting point. From there, starting from the bottom, each layer of the model were re-written.
The aim was to write as many of the functions as possible yourself, trying to use minimal amount of functions from TensorFlow library.

The project was first made in Google Colab but after the course ended, I refactored it in PyCharm.
